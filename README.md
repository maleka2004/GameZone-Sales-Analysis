## Product Background
GameZone is an e-commerce company specializing in gaming-related products, ranging from consoles to accessories. This project analyzes GameZone’s sales data from 2019 to 2022, with the objective of uncovering key trends and performance drivers. By examining revenue patterns over time and exploring breakdowns by product category, region, and marketing channel, this analysis aims to deliver insights and recommendations to support decisions across the sales, marketing, and product teams.

## Executive Summary
GameZone’s sales trend analysis of 20k+ records from 2019 to 2022 reveals a total revenue of $6 million, driven primarily by three core products: the Sony PlayStation 5 Bundle, Nintendo Switch, and a 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor. While North America and EMEA lead overall performance, regions like APAC and LATAM remain under-penetrated. Direct marketing channels contributed nearly 85% of revenue, suggesting high reliance on a single outreach method. Additionally, mobile platform usage remains low, accounting for less than 3% of sales. Customer retention declined by 12% from 2019 to 2020, highlighting the need for stronger loyalty or re-engagement strategies. To accelerate growth, GameZone could expand top product lines into underperforming regions, diversify its marketing strategy, and enhance its mobile experience to improve platform engagement and drive long-term revenue.
